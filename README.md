## About

DogCare is a website for managing canine appointments easily with a calendar view.

This project was created above all as part of a school project to familiarize
ourselves with the Angular and Spring frameworks, while making us use the Scrum
method within the development.

Feel free to use the code for your own purposes and contribute to this
repository.
